\title{fix elevation to origin}
\usage{
fix_z_to_origin(relative_blocks, ArticulationVect)
}
\arguments{
\item{relative_blocks}{a data frame containing the outputs from the}

\item{ArticulationVect}{The articulation nodes of the network.}
}
\description{
This function makes the elevation of the different blocks all relative to the same fixed point, 
this allows easy use of bi-connected components This is a helper function only.
z is used instead of elevation for legacy issues. This can be changed when I can be bothered
}
\details{
The function needs to be renamed to make it more SETSe friendly something like fix_elevation_to_origin. But I need to see what it will impact first
