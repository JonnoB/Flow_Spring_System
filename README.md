Flow_Spring_System

These are the functions used to make a spring system in equillibrium out of a balanced flow network.
The functions allow a 2d network to be converted into a 3D network using a simple physics model.


The equilibrium can also be found using an unbalanced spring system but only the rate of change of
acceleration will reach zero. the acceleration will remain constant and the velocity will increase to infintiy.
