# network_spring_embedding
This package is used to calculate the strain elevation and tension embeddings produced by the SETS algorithm. 
It also contains some additional functions for analysis of the results

The code used in this package is part of my PhD and a fundemental compooment of three projects

* An introduction to the SETS algorithm
* An analysis of network robustness using power-grids
* An Analysis of non-flow networks for graph classification and higher dimensional projection and isomorphism

# N.B

The package is still underdevleopment and does not have any examples of code. For current examples of code see 
[setse_and_network_robustness](https://github.com/JonnoB/setse_and_network_robustness/edit/master/README.md).
